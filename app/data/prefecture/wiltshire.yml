  A Great Bustard (Otis tarda) is depicted in gold on a solid green circle to represent the 
  open grassland. The border of the circle, in six sections alternating green and white, represents
  the stone circles of Stonehenge and Avebury in the county. The six portions also represent the six
  surrounding counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire, Dorset and Somerset.

  The "Bustard Flag" was created by Mike Prior and designed by Helen Pocock, a graphic designer, 
  in 2007. It is partly based on the flag of the Wiltshire County Council, including the alternating
  stripes of green and white that represent the grassy downs of the county and their chalk underlay.

    The colours can represent hope, joy and safety (green) and peace (white). Although distinct, the
  complicated and irregular design has been met with some criticism by flag designers and
  heraldists.

    An image of the great bustard (Otis tarda) stands at the centre of the flag. This bird had been
  extinct in England since 1832, but is now part of an intensive ten-year breeding programme on
  Salisbury Plain. Salisbury Plain, at the heart of the county, is one of only two areas in Great
  Britain in which the great bustard originally lived. On the flag, the male great bustard is
  depicted in gold on a solid green circle to represent the open grassland. The border of the
  circle, in six sections alternating green and white, represents the stone circles of Stonehenge
  and Avebury in the county. The six portions also represent the six surrounding counties of
  Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire, Dorset and Somerset.
