  The swan emblem dates back to Anglo-Saxon times when Buckinghamshire was known for breeding swans 
  for the king. As a county bounded by the River Thames, water fowl are endemic to the locality and 
  swans are common. The specific design of the flag is based upon the arms used by the 
  Buckinghamshire County Council, which in turn are derived from heraldic badges variously borne by 
  local nobility, in the post Anglo-Saxon era.

    Swans on arms often appear without any further adornment but one particular style includes a ducal
  coronet about the neck and a gold chain “reflexed” over its back, which is termed “a cygnet 
  (i.e. a young swan) royal”. This is the form used on the Buckinghamshire flag. The collar of a 
  ducal coronet  may be a reference to the Duke of Buckingham, as the swan on the Bucks flag was 
  certainly his badge but a swan of this type had been used as a badge previously by earlier 
  nobility and possibly might just have been a mark of high rank.
